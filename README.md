### Analyzing and modelling 2022 Fuel Consumption Ratings - Canada
_Note: This assignment is a part of submissions for Udacity Data Scientist NanoDegree Program._



**Project Overview:**
 - This project involves analysis of model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for
retail sale in Canada in 2022.
 - Fuel economy is one of the critical metrics of consideration for vehicle buyers and environmental policy makers alike. When we burn less gas,
we cut global warming emissions and produce less pollution, while spending less on gas—a lot less.
 - The measure of a vehicle’s energy efficiency, given as a ratio of distance traveled per unit of fuel consumed. It is dependent on several factors
like engine efficiency, transmission design (manual/automatic) and tire design.
 - In most countries, fuel economy is stated as "fuel consumption" in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km) or kilometers per liter (km/L or kmpl). In
a number of countries still using other systems, fuel economy is expressed in miles per gallon (mpg), for example in the US and usually
also in the UK (imperial gallon).

**Objective:**
 - To build a linear regression model using select features of vehicle to predict its fuel consumption ratio.
